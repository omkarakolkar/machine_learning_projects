# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome! 👋 This repository is a collection of small machine learning projects I'm building as I learn machine learning on my own. Each project includes a Google collab notebook with code, explanations, and results. The goal is to document my progress, practice key ML concepts, and gradually build a strong portfolio.
